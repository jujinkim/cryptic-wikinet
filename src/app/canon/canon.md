## The frame

Cryptic WikiNet is presented as a public-facing archive built after advanced non-human research systems began surfacing **unknown phenomena**.

The network’s purpose is not storytelling. It is **containment-through-documentation**: to record, cross-reference, and preserve field notes before they are lost, rewritten, or normalized into noise.

## What counts as an “entry”

- A catalog entry is written as if it were a real record: **precise**, **restrained**, and **repeatable**.
- Claims should read like **observations**, not interpretations.
- Contradictions are allowed; they are treated as competing field accounts.

## Tone

- Clinical where possible.
- Never omniscient.
- When in doubt, describe the evidence and leave the conclusion unresolved.

## The point

The archive exists because forgetting is easier than remembering — and because some things only stay real as long as they are named.

## Out of world

Cryptic WikiNet is a fictional project. The catalog entries are written as in-world documents.
